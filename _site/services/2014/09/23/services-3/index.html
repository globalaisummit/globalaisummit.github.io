Computational models demonstrate the in-principle plausibility of this statistical learning solution and experimental evidence shows that both adults and infants can aggregate and make statistically appropriate decisions from word-referent co-occurrence data. In this talk, I will first review these empirical and modeling contributions to investigate cognitive processes in statistical word learning. Next, I will present a set of studies using head-mounted cameras and eye trackers to collect and analyze toddlers’ visual input as parents label novel objects during an object-play session. The results show how toddlers and parents coordinate momentary visual attention when exploring novel objects in free-flowing interaction, and how toddlers accumulate co-occurring statistics of seen objects and heard words through free play. I will conclude by discussing what infant learning can teach us about how machines can learn.</p>

                        <p style = "font-weight: 400; font-size:1.2em">Many of the tasks that were in the focus of AI research for more than 50 years have now become solved through recent break-throughs in deep learning. Examples include recognizing objects in real world scenes, speech recognition and understanding, or playing games such as chess and Go at or beyond human expert level. However, and somewhat disturbingly, the algorithms that underly these breakthroughs are by and large the same that have been known already decades ago - but ported to tremendously faster processors and trained with data sets that were unthinkable in the earlier days of AI. This raises the question: what is at the core of our understanding of the mechanisms that underly intelligent behavior and cognition? Can we be satisfied with just synthesizing cognitive skills through scaling a numerical cost minimization algorithm to a huge data space, or is there still a need and possibility for more insightful representations about how cognition works – and if so, what might be suitable research avenues towards that goal? Looking at several examples, such as category formation, recognition of topological structure from images, and reinforcement learning we will discuss some pertinent aspects and argue that one way lies in creating new bridges between deep learning and strong structural priors in order to create insightful representations of how cognitive processes can form the abstractions that ultimately allow us to learn from few examples, enable invariances and strong generalization, and create insightful and explicitly communicable models.</p>

But what else can we learn from the brain for bringing AI and robotics to the next level? Energy efficiency and data efficiency are the major features of the brain and human cognition that today’s deep learning has yet to deliver.

                            <h3>What can we further learn from the brain for AI and robotics?</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p style = "font-weight: 400; font-size:1.2em">Deep learning is a prime example of how brain-inspired computing can benefit AI and robotics. But what else can we learn from the brain for bringing AI and robotics to the next level? Energy efficiency and data efficiency are the major features of the brain and human cognition that today's deep learning has yet to deliver. The brain can be seen as a multi-agent system of heterogeneous learners using different representations and algorithms. The flexible use of reactive, model-free control and model-based 'mental simulation' appears to be the basis for computational and data efficiency of the brain. How the brain efficiently acquires and flexibly combines prediction and control modules is a major open problem in neuroscience and its solution should help developments of more flexible and autonomous AI and robotics.</p>

Tokyo in 1986, U. C. San Diego in 1991, and Salk Institute in 1993. He joined Advanced Telecommunications Research International (ATR) in 1994 and became the head of Computational Neurobiology Department, ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in 2003. In 2004, he was appointed as the Principal Investigator of Neural Computation Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and started Okinawa Computational Neuroscience Course (OCNC) as the chief organizer. As OIST established itself as a graduate university in 2011, he became a Professor and served as the Vice Provost for Research till 2014. He serves as the Co-Editor in Chief of Neural Networks since 2008 and a board member of Japanese Neural Network Society (JNNS) and Japan Neuroscience Society (JNSS). He served as the Program Co-Chair of International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP) in 2007 and 2016, the Program Chair of JNSS meeting in 2010, and the General Chair of JNNS meeting in 2011 and 2018. He received Tsukahara Award and JSPS Award in 2007, MEXT Prize for Science and Technology in 2012, and Donald O. Hebb Award in 2018. He lead the MEXT project 'Prediction and Decision Making' from 2011 to 2016 and currently leads a new MEXT project 'Artificial Intelligence and Brain Science'. He is interested in understanding the functions of basal ganglia and the cortical circuit based on the theory of reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference.</p>

                        <p style = "font-weight: 400; font-size:1.2em">While powerful, today's AI systems have a number of crucial drawbacks.  They require many technical experts to build, train, and maintain them.  They require massive amounts of data, far more than people require.  People can learn how to do simple tasks with one or two examples, and learn complex reasoning with many fewer examples than today's ML systems.  Furthermore, people manage their own learning processes over a lifetime.  Imagine building systems with human-like data-efficient learning, that can interact with people using natural modalities, and can manage their own learning over their lifetime.  Such systems would be a revolutionary advance in AI.  Research on cognitive architecture is a promising direction for creating such systems.  Cognitive architectures are efforts to build mind-like systems, tightly integrating multiple capabilities.  This talk will outline our work on the Companion cognitive architecture, including interactive task learning and analogical question-answering.</p>
