                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <p>Recent theory and experiments offer a solution as to how human learners may break into word learning, by using cross-situational statistics to find the underlying word-referent mappings. Computational models demonstrate the in-principle plausibility of this statistical learning solution and experimental evidence shows that both adults and infants can aggregate and make statistically appropriate decisions from word-referent co-occurrence data. In this talk, I will first review these empirical and modeling contributions to investigate cognitive processes in statistical word learning. Next, I will present a set of studies using head-mounted cameras and eye trackers to collect and analyze toddlersâ€™ visual input as parents label novel objects during an object-play session. The results show how toddlers and parents coordinate momentary visual attention when exploring novel objects in free-flowing interaction, and how toddlers accumulate co-occurring statistics of seen objects and heard words through free play. I will conclude by discussing what infant learning can teach us about how machines can learn.</p>
