                        <p style = "font-weight: 400; font-size:1.2em">While powerful, today's AI systems have a number of crucial drawbacks.  They require many technical experts to build, train, and maintain them.  They require massive amounts of data, far more than people require.  People can learn how to do simple tasks with one or two examples, and learn complex reasoning with many fewer examples than today's ML systems.  Furthermore, people manage their own learning processes over a lifetime.  Imagine building systems with human-like data-efficient learning, that can interact with people using natural modalities, and can manage their own learning over their lifetime.  Such systems would be a revolutionary advance in AI.  Research on cognitive architecture is a promising direction for creating such systems.  Cognitive architectures are efforts to build mind-like systems, tightly integrating multiple capabilities.  This talk will outline our work on the Companion cognitive architecture, including interactive task learning and analogical question-answering.</p>
